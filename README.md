### Introduction
Mental illness is becoming a serious global health problem worldwide, with a growing number of
patients suffering from depression, anxiety and other disorders. New solutions are needed to tackle this
issue. The main goal of this research project is to develop prediction models to classify users with poor
mental health from social network data.The data has been label encoded for better prediction. The data is 
being subject to various machine learning techniques to obtain labels. These classified labels will then be
used to build a model to predict the mental health of an individual. Our target population is in the working class.
